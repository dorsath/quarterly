The idea

A website where you can manage your project's stories and do the usual agile management. But this time directly linked to cucumber/spinach tests.

Whenever a new story gets created, before it can be put into progress you must first write your gherkin feature in the system. 
When it's put into progress it will create a new branch and add the feature in gherkin, push, and pull-request.
When it's put into feedback all the tests should run accordingly. And it can only be put onto feedback if all the tests run.

The direct link between your agile management and tests further enforces a way of working. 

What I envision is a website where you can start a new project, link up the github repository and the project management software becomes a participant in the process
